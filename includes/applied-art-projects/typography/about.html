        <p>In the last summer before the millennium, Baz Luhrmannâ€™s <span class="wearsunscreen_b">Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)</span> gently racketed through radio speakers and headphones around the world.But Luhrmann never wrote those words. Rather, they had been composed on a sunny, late Spring afternoon after a walk around Lake Michigan, by Chicago Tribute journalist <span class="wearsunscreen_b">Mary Schmich.</span></p> <br>  
            
        <p>The essay was used in its entirety by Australian film director Baz Luhrmann on his 1998 album Something for Everybody, as <span class="wearsunscreen_b">"Everybody's Free (To Wear Sunscreen)". </span>It was released in some territories in 1997, with the speech (including its opening words, "Ladies and Gentlemen of the Class of '97") completely intact. This version appeared in the Triple J Hottest 100 of that year at number 16 in the countdown, and was released on the subsequent CD in early 1998.</p><br>

           

        <p>Also known as "The Sunscreen Song", the song features a spoken-word track set over a mellow backing track. The "Wear Sunscreen" speech is narrated by Australian voice actor Lee Perry.The backing is the choral version of <span class="wearsunscreen_b">"Everybody's Free (To Feel Good)"</span>, a 1991 song by <span class="wearsunscreen_b">Rozalla,</span> used in Luhrmann's film William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet. The chorus, also from "Everybody's Free", is sung by Quindon Tarver.</p><br>
            
        <p>The song or spoken word evokes a rather strong sense of nostalgia to anyone who listens to the words, for youths who nurse unpredictable feelings of anticipation for the future and even mature individuals reflecting on the life they have lived so far, wished they could have done some things differently, or just reminiscing through personal thoughts. </p><br>
