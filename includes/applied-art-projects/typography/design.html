        <h2 class="about_section_header">My Selection</h2> 
        <p>The feelings of nostalgia, life and growing up have always been fascinating to me and i decided on this piece based on the fact that i wanted to work on something that i felt i could relate to in some way. Having struggled in childhood at times to find good advice that i felt i could really relate to, it was largely refreshing to hear a somewhat laid-back but meaningful speech about handling some of the little things in life</p> <br>  
            
            <h2 class="about_section_header">Design Decisions</h2>
        <p>The predominance of my idea's for this project came from the actual video of the speech and also a strong nostalgia for high school days as that was my graduating year of school and it no doubt eludes a warm mid-summer's feeling.</p><br>
           
            
            <span class="wearsunscreen_b">Colours</span><p>I chose a soft background colour background-color: #FFFEF6; to evoke a soft and light feeling as the general scenery of the speech eludes summer periods</p><P>,in order to enable the letters and words stand out, i went for a somewhat softer shade of beige for the inset where the words will be displayed.</P><br>
            <span class="wearsunscreen_b">Font/Typefaces</span><p>For the general passage, i decided to go with a type face that was easily readable but at the same time not too serious as with the general mood of the speech and how it was delievered, the author attempted to deliver a speech of general advice that could have a sense of formality attached to it in such a light hearted humourus fashion. The "Dorsa" font selection for the heading of the page came about as a thing of the 90's, i remember this being used heavily in TV media talk shows, kids programmes and even on TV shirts. and i felt it would be a good addition.</p>
