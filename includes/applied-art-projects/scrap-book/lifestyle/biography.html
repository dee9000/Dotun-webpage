			<h2>About Me</h2>

	<p>As life would have it i was born on November 16, 1981, in a large town. Spent most of my early years being fascinated by all things creative. None of my immediate parents were creative in anyway as my Father a chattered account was the most logical individual you could find. And my Mother a health care professional, so it was somewhat of a mystery where my artistic flare came from. Most of my early years were spent doing a lot of drawings and paintings and constant re-sketching as to get to perfection.</p>


	<p>After a 6 year hiatus from the constant drawings due to pressures of academic pursuits, i finally rekindled the inspiration to explore my creative spirit after a visit to an Architecture department of a local university. Seeing so many creatives crammed up in one department fascinated me, and i imagined the possibilites and inspiration one could get from being around kindred spirits.</p>


	<p>It still took a while to come to the decision to pursue a Web related discipline, however; that decision was spurred on after spending 2 years working for NOW TV and the Sky UK offices and collaborating first hand with web designers and developers on bringing the site to life. Which is where i currently find myself now, finally studying and learning to one day become a fully fledged Web designer/developer, or as the industry experts call them.... </p>
