<p>This hair clipper comes in an aerodynamically designed form factor giving it not only an aesthetic appeal but also practical efficiency.</p>

<p><span class="paragraph-heading-color">Material:</span> It’s made of a rubberized plastic material that allows for essential gripping, this helps against slipping even with wet environmental conditions such as when it’s being used in the bathroom.</p>
 

<p><span class="paragraph-heading-color">Ergonomics: </span>when held in hand, the clipper feels very comfortable at the handle as the design has allowed for the handle grip end to be slightly thinner that the opposite cutting edge which is noticeably wider and slightly heavier as it houses the blades. Also the positioning of the “on” button is such that it is easy to keep hold of the clipper quite comfortably, whilst using the thumb to switch it on without any thought whatsoever.</p>
             
<p><span class="paragraph-heading-color">Extending blades:</span> This unique feature allows for easy cleaning the blade without the risk of damaging internet electrical components. The design allows the blades to slide forwards away from the rest of the body of the clipper, allowing for ease of cleaning.</p>
