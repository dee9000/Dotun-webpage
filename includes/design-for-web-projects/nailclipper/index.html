<h3>2. The Nail Clipper</h3>

<p><span class="paragraph-heading-color">Portability:</span> The Nail clipper is quite an inconspicuous item and is designed in small form factor which makes it easy to fold away compartmentalizing a small nail file within it's fold. This simulates an army knife type design which means even when stored away in a pocket for instance, rest assured there wont be any holes to mend.</p>
        

<p> <span class="paragraph-heading-color">Functionality:</span> One of the more unique design features i have observed from a nail clipper is actually its ability to simulate a mechanical like spring motion once being used, but without actually having any physical springs to perform this act.

Utilising a simple extension and compression technique, the nail clipper has been designed to use the uppermost part of the metal material, turned in an upright position and when pressed, forces the clip motion observed at the 2 lower metals linked at the bottom hereby causing a "bounce-back"of the item.</p>
             
             
<p><span class="paragraph-heading-color">Doubles as a key chain:</span> using the tiny hole at the end of the clipper, i have used this to attach keys or it can also be hooked on to a wall.</p>
