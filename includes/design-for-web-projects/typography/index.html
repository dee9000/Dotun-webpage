         <h1>I HAVE A DREAM</h1>
    <h2>By The Revd. Martin L. King</h2>
        <h3>28th Aug 1963</h3>

<div class="inner-wrapper">

    <p>Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends.
        And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the <span class=patriot_red>American</span> <span class="patriot_blue"> dream.</span></p>
<br>

    <p><span class="hold">I have a dream</span> <br>that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: <span class="quotation"><br>"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."</span><br></p>
    <br>


<p><span class="hold">I have a dream </span><br>that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood.</p>
    <br>


<p><span class="hold">I have a dream </span><br>that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of <span class="patriot_red">freedom</span> and <span class="patriot_blue">justice.</span></p>
    <br>


<p><span class="hold">I have a dream </span><br>that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.</p>
    <br>


    <p><span class="hold">I have a dream today!</span></p>
    <br>


    <p>that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of<br><span class="quotation">"interposition" and "nullification"<br> </span>one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as <span class="patriot_blue">sisters</span> and <span class="patriot_red">brothers.</span></p>
    <br>


    <p> <span class="hold">I have a dream today!</span></p>
    <br>


    <p>one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; <span class="quotation"><br>"and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together."<br></span></p>
    
<br>


<p>This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with.</p>
