<p>Over the years, the world of Digital photography has progressed and as such we have seen cameras evolve from complicated hardware devices to into smaller form factors such as compact cameras or its integration into mobile phones.
However, the shape of the SLR camera stands the test of time.</p>
<p><span> Sturdiness:</span> It still regains its rugged form factor which demonstrates that it is built and designed to last and withstand physical damage.</p> 

 <p><span class="paragraph-heading-color">Grip Factor:</span> The EOS 60D grip has been re-designed with textured rubberized surface with contours that allow the users fingers to fit in perfectly, this allows for a very comfortable fit without fears that it will slip and fall.</p> 

<p><span class="paragraph-heading-color">The trigger:</span> Located just above the rubberized grip, this has been ergonomically placed to allow the user effectively hold on the camera with at least 3 fingers and at the same time able to utilize their index finger to take the camera shot without the camera falling out of their hands.</p> 
             
<p><span class="paragraph-heading-color">Articulating screen:</span> Otherwise known as a tilt screen, this model allows it's users to manipulate the screen into any position they prefer even when being the subject of the photograph, and when not in use, it has been carefully designed to fold back into place with the screen facing inward in order to avoid scratches or damages, a common problem with electronic digital devices.
